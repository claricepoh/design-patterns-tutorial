## Dependency Injection
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (Ioc) between classes and their dependencies. 
It allows a class to receive its dependencies from outside the class, rather than instantiating dependencies inside the class.

## How to implement
Refer code snippet.

### Type of Dependency Injection
